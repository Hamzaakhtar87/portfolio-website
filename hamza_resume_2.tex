% About Me / Summary
\section*{ABOUT ME}
I'm a Computer Science graduate focused on AI, with practical experience in ML, computer vision, and Python development. I've worked with tools like PyTorch, OpenCV, AWS, and Azure, and I also understand blockchain and Web3 from real community and ambassador roles. I enjoy building AI projects, analyzing data, and turning ideas into working systems—and I'm ready to contribute as an AI Developer, Python Developer, Data Analyst, or Community Manager.
